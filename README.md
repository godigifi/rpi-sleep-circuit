# Raspberry Pi Power Regulator with Sleep Mode

This code is intended to be used in the [Adafruit Trinket](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1501)-controlled 
[Pololu power regulator](http://www.pololu.com/product/2866) described in [this article](http://leviathan.godigi.fi/24-raspberry-pi-shutdown-circuit-with-sleep-mode).

## Building the Trinket code

The Trinket code depends on [TinyWireS library](https://github.com/rambo/TinyWire/tree/master/TinyWireS).
To build the code download and extract TinyWireS library into your **sketchbook/libraries** directory.
